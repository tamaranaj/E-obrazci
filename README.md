## E-Obrazci Application Overview

The **E-Obrazci** Application is an innovative web-based solution developed using React to streamline the creation and submission of application forms for the issuance of identification cards, passports, and driver’s licenses in the Republic of North Macedonia. Designed with user privacy and convenience in mind, this application allows users to easily complete required forms and generate PDF documents that can be printed for submission.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First Design**: The application does not utilize cookies or rely on external services or servers for the processing or storage of personal data. All form generation and data processing occur exclusively within the user’s browser, ensuring that no personal information leaves the user’s device.

- **PDF Generation**: Powered by jsPDF, a robust JavaScript library, the application enables seamless creation and manipulation of PDF files directly within the browser, providing users with a fully offline experience.

- **State Management**: The application leverages React's Context API to effectively manage the application state, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across the platform.

## Important Notes

- **Security & Privacy**: Users should remain cautious, as similar applications may exist, and the level of data protection may vary depending on the security practices of third-party services. This application takes extensive measures to safeguard personal data, but users should always be mindful of the platforms they interact with.

- **Disclaimer**: Please note that this application is an independent project and is not affiliated with the Ministry of Internal Affairs or any other government agency.
