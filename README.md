## E-obrazci Application

The **E-Obrazci Application** is a React-based solution designed to simplify the creation of application forms for the issuance of ID cards, passports, and driver's licenses for citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia. Users can easily fill out the necessary forms and generate PDF documents, which can then be printed for submission. The PDF generation is powered by **jsPDF**, a JavaScript library that enables the creation and manipulation of PDF files directly in the browser.

To manage the application state efficiently, the app leverages **React's Context API**, ensuring smooth data flow and a seamless user experience across the platform.
